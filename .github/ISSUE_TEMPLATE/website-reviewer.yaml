        The Documentation and Community SIG maintains several reviewer roles requiring SIG approval - this nomination form is for serving as a _website reviewer_, responsible for reviewing contributions that add layouts, templates, improve functionality, or change the appearance of o3de.org in some way. Responsibilities include:

        * Review changes to layouts, partials, and any website javascript submissions.
        
        **Maintaing status:** Serve in the reviewer rotation as required. Serving in the review rotation requires prompt responses to
        feedback questions, in addition to the initial review. SIG chairpersons and maintainers will remove reviewers who don't meet this requirement on 
        a regular basis.

        For more on the general requirements of Reviewer roles, read our [Community Membership](https://github.com/o3de/community/blob/main/community-membership.md) information.
