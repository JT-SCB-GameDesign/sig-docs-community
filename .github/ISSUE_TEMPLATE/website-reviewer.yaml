        The Documentation and Community SIG maintains several reviewer roles requiring SIG approval - this nomination form is for serving as a _website reviewer_, responsible for reviewing contributions that add layouts, templates, improve functionality, or change the appearance of [o3de.org](https://www.o3de.org/) in some way. Responsibilities include:

        * Review changes to layouts, partials, and any website development submissions.
        * Provide guidance on discussions surrounding website development, as needed.
        * Advocate for quality changes to uphold the website's infrastructure.
        **Maintaining status:** Serve in the reviewer rotation as required. Serving in the review rotation requires an initial review of the submission,
         as well as prompt follow-up responses to feedback questions. SIG chairpersons and maintainers will remove reviewers who don't meet this requirement on 
        a regular basis.

        For more information about the general requirements of reviewer roles, read our [Community Membership](https://github.com/o3de/community/blob/main/community-membership.md) information.
