        The Documentation and Community SIG maintains several reviewer roles requiring SIG approval - this nomination form is for serving as a _documentation reviewer_, responsible for reviewing contributions to `o3de.org/docs`. Documentation reviewers are expected to:

        * Help guide structure and intent of documentation submissions. Writing documentation is hard and often a subjective exercise, so reviewers are expected to exercise both their best judgement and follow common site structure and [templates](https://www.o3de.org/docs/contributing/to-docs/templates/) where available.
        * Help ensure consistency of product [terminology](https://www.o3de.org/docs/contributing/to-docs/terminology/).
        * Review content submissions with an eye towards following the [style guide](https://www.o3de.org/docs/contributing/to-docs/style-guide/).

        **Maintaining status:** 4+ Pull Requests reviewed per month, or as-assigned. Under light PR load, these requirements are relaxed. Not meeting this requirement for two months in a row results in loss of reviewer status.

        For more information, read our SIG's [Documentation and Community reviewer roles](https://github.com/o3de/sig-docs-community/blob/main/governance/reviewers-maintainers.md).
