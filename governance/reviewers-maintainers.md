Unlike other Special Interest Groups (SIGs), the O3DE Documentation and Community SIG maintains two reviewer roles requiring SIG approval: *Documentation reviewer* and *technical reviewer*. Learn how to become either, and file a [nomination issue](https://github.com/o3de/sig-docs-community/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=reviewer-maintainer-nomination.md&title=SIG+Reviewer%2FMaintainer+Nomination) to become an official reviewer or maintainer!

For more on the Reviewer and Maintainer roles, read our [Community Membership](https://github.com/o3de/community/blob/main/community-membership.md) information.

### Nomination Guidelines

#### Documentation reviewer

_Documentation reviewers_ review for conformance with the [style guide](https://o3de.org/docs/contributing/to-docs/style-guide/), appropriateness of content, and other subjective factors to keep documentation content aligned. 

To become a documentation reviewer, you must have:

* 6+ documentation contributions merged to o3de.org or O3DE
* 2+ Reviewer or Maintainers of the Documentation and Community SIG who support the nomination.

**Maintaining status:** 4+ Pull Requests reviewed per month.

#### Technical reviewer

_Technical reviewers_ review for technical accuracy alone: They make sure that described steps, features, file formats, code examples, and other parts of documentation that are deeply technical match the _current_ product state. Often, technical reviewers come from the pool of implementers for the feature being documented.

To become a technical reviewer, you must have:

* Reviewer or Maintainer status in a SIG governing the appropriate technology.
* 1+ of the appropriate SIG's Reviewers or Maintainers who support the promotion.
* 1+ D&C Reviewers or Maintainers who support the promotion.

**Maintaining status:** Serve in the technical review rotation for your SIG as required by their available pool of reviewers. Due to the low number of technical reviews that some SIGs require, there is no minimum number of pull requests needed to maintain status. Each SIG sets their technical reviewer rotation at their discretion.

#### Documentation maintainer

_Documentation maintainers_ are experienced reviewers who perform more frequent review, and are willing to take on a higher level of responsibility with the SIG.

* [ ] Has been a Reviewer for 2+ months
* [ ] 8+ reviewed Pull Requests in the previous 2 months
* [ ] 2+ D&C SIG Maintainers who support promotion.

**Maintaining status:** 8+ Pull Requests reviewed per month.
