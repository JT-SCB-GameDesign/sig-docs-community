## Documentation and Community reviewer roles

The Documentation and Community SIG maintains the following reviewer teams:

* [**Documentation Reviewer**](https://github.com/orgs/o3de/teams/docs-reviewers) - Responsible for reviewing documentation content to `o3de.org`, or conducting reviews of certain `o3de` in-product documentation elements.
* **Community Reviewer** - Responsible for reviewing community materials, including contributor guides and blogs.

We also have [SIG maintainers](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/discussions). Documentation and Community maintainers are reviewers who have been elevated from the documentation or community reviewer teams to take on additional responsibility and serve as trusted sources of guidance.

### Technical reviewer roles

The Documentation and Community SIG also maintains a documentation technical reviewer team for the `o3de.org` website and its related infrastructure. Documentation technical reviewers are responsible for representing their SIG during documentation review, and ensuring technical accuracy of content.
