## Documentation and Community reviewer roles

The Documentation and Community SIG maintains the following reviewer pools:

* **Documentation Reviewer** - Responsible for reviewing documentation content to `o3de.org`, or conducting reviews of certain `o3de` in-product documentation elements.
* **Community Reviewer** - Responsible for reviewing community materials, including contributor guides and blogs.

We also have maintainers, as other SIGs do. Documentation and Community maintainers are reviewers who have been elevated from the documentation or community
reviewer pools to take on additional responsibility, and serve as trusted sources of guidance.

### Technical reviewer roles

The Documentation and Community SIG also maintains a technical reviewer pool for the `o3de.org` website and its related infrastructure.

The technical SIGs also maintain reviewer pools for becoming a technical reviewer. There is a standard [baseline requirement](./docs-tech-review-template.yaml) for becoming a technical reviewer for any SIG. Serving as a docs technical reviewer is at the discretion of the associated SIG, and they may change qualifications for being a reviewer at any time.
