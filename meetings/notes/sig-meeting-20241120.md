# Docs & Community SIG meeting - 2024-11-20

**Facilitator:**  Shauna Gordon (@ShaunaGordon)
**Notes taker:**  Shauna Gordon (@ShaunaGordon)

[Agenda](https://github.com/o3de/sig-docs-community/issues/133)

## SIG Updates

* Shauna and JT talked about goals for the coming year
    * Both in agreement that the overarching goal is to make docs more approachable, both for engine users and docs contributors, through streamlining and better audience targeting
* JT shared a bunch of information from his industry experience (see links below) and advocated a "Lean Documentation" approach. Both agreed that this is definitely necessary for a "quickstart" section that allows new engine users to go from 0 to something presentable in less than 3 hours
    * His ultimate goal is to be able to get users productive on O3DE with as little as a few minutes of research for every hour of productive work (the "holy grail" of docs)
* Audience targeting, using the "5 Computer Users" framework, will also help us identify actual people and groups in the community that we can approach as testers of the documentation. These people will allow us to refine that quickstart content to *actual* needs and use-cases.
* As of meeting, Shauna still waiting on repos, but Joe's been swamped with the event circuit


### Action items

* Shauna to read up on resources JT shared
* Shauna and JT to work on outlining design changes to facilitate new vision
* Shauna to continue working on getting repos to break the Hugo site into API, theme, and content
