## SIG Updates

Updates from the SIG itself. Information will be provided in advance on the agenda issue.

* Progress is being made on getting Shauna maintainer status
* Kythera approved removing their content from O3DE docs
* Jan mentioned that he thinks only Mike Chang can start the stabilization process? He's going to confirm what the process is for that at the next TSC meeting
* Jan will fix DCO error and merge conflicts on cherry-pick PR
  * Will have his team from sig-sim do additional review and push approve/merge buttons, since Shauna can't and Roddie has been unavailable
  * Will get to it Friday (today was already EOD for him, and Thursday is a bank holiday in Poland)

### Action items

* Jan
  * Get cherry-pick PR fixed and merged
  * Confirm stabilization protocol with TSC
* Shauna
  * Merge/close PR backlog once she gets perms, if no one beats her to it
  * Start triaging Issues for Stabilization candidates

## Miscellaneous

Poland has a holiday on Thursday -- [Assumption of Mary](https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/poland/assumption-of-mary), which according to timeanddate.com is half Catholic holiday (the day God assumed the Virgin Mary into heaven) and half remembrance of the Battle of Warsaw (a battle during the war between the Poles and the Bolsheviks, a keystone battle in Poland's fight for independence, and blocking the spread of Soviet totalitarianism) and the soldiers who died in the war.
