**Facilitator:**  Shauna Gordon (@ShaunaGordon)
**Notes taker:**  Shauna Gordon (@ShaunaGordon)

(Agenda not created for this meeting.)

## SIG Updates

Shauna 
- reviewed/closed a couple of PRs

Jan
- Created stabilization branch, now redirecting PRs to it

JT 
- Still ramping up in-person stuff

### Open questions

2025 Docs Goals:

- Rearchitect site for easier content contribution (Shauna to spearhead work on this)
    - Side effect - ability to translate docs 
      - Note - set up fallbacks to English if a page isn't yet translated
        - It's not uncommon for only some pages to be translated, for various reasons
- Flesh out the Engine Developer Guide (community effort)
  - Lots of parts needed to be able to build a useful foundation
  - Most of the internals were built by Amazon people, who have sense moved to other things. Need to find new people with knowledge of parts.

### Action items

- Cherry-pick stabilization commits back to dev (Jan will do once #2589 is merged)
- Add new version to picker on website (just get PR in for now), Shauna will do
- Jan will be reviewing Robotec docs to add upstream
- Reminder: PR freeze 9/24
- Shauna to share release process notes from firehose meeting a few months back


## Miscellaneous

- JT called out that he gives feedback of i18n verbiage to help disambiguate some words/phrases with international audiences (and avoid some faux pas from international definitions)
- International Technical and Business Language Dictionary
  - reference to standardize language for things like documentation for international audiences
  - expensive to purchase, but maybe some people in the community already have copies/access to it and can help with reviewing content?
- Game engine evaluator
  - role in game studios
  - looks at docs as part of analysis and often contribute back to docs
  - a big reason to work to keep docs up to date and have regular activity
